On opening the program, you are greeted with a register page, from which you have to choose whether you'll login or sign up. In case of you "Signing Up": it is required of you to enter each of the following in order to create an account on the program:

- First name
- Second name
- Username
- Password

*Noting the essentiality of your **username** and **password**, you should remember them for a seamless login later on.* As for after you sign up, you are directed back to login, where you are in front of a choice between logging in as either an Admin or a user. There, you are required to enter your username and password before choosing.

### ADMIN:

In case you logged in as an ***Admin*** you are directed into a cute, gentle scene. Welcome to the lair of the mastermind of our program. Welcome, ***boss.*** You have a small yet crucial button at the top right corner of the scene, that's the notification button, where all the sent requests from the user are preserved awaiting your response be it a yes (approve) or a no (reject).

*With three simple yet deadly buttons you can access:*

***User Management***: as the big boss of this whole party, you can control your users quite well, you get to view a wide list of user accounts (you can clearly see their usernames and passwords), where you, by the snap of your fingers, can add another one to them, update their information, delete some of them, or even retrieve their information. How sly!

As the king of stocks, you can also manage your stocks seamlessly, by ***Stock management*** button, having the options of adding new stocks to our cute stock list, you have the option of deleting them, retrieving their information. But last and not least you can update their parameters. Please have some conscience with the prices, dear admin; we're not this wealthy!

The third and last button, ***"stock orders"***, the quiet stalker of the program. On typing the stock label you have in mind, and for which you want to get information on, you are greeted with a list of the operations done on that stock, how many of it was sold, how many was bought, along with their prices. Beware of the silent stalker!!

### USER:

In case you chose to be a ***User***, you're a lucky man, since you'll get to enjoy a variety of features. You are directed into a button-filled scene, where you are faced by the features of being a user in our program. First and foremost, you have to fill in your wallet, to enjoy an amusing journey of stocks and bonds buying. So don't forget that, or you won't be able to buy even a piece of paper.

- Not to mention, you have to enter the exact number of stocks you'd like to buy, assuming you already chose the exact stock you are eyeing, once bought you can click on your ***"Order management button"***, where whatever stocks you buy during your session are safely stored for you, in case you, by any chance, wanted to sell them. You have a nice sell button for you to perform whatever selling operations you'd like, so feel free, our smart investor.
- ***Deposit/Withdrawal along with financial actions history***: that's where you make requests for depositions or withdrawals and then wait for our dear admin to either accept or reject them. They are pending until the admin gives you a yes or a no. Financial actions history: that's where you have a simple yet detailed and easy-to-understand tables that show you exactly how your past financial matters with the admin went. Transaction history: includes any money-involving actions you make, whether it's buying, selling, deposit or withdrawal either pending or completed.
- ***Price history***: Since stocks be always going up and down, high and low, of course you should have a history that shows you all that, helping you keep track on the current stock market to make better decisions on stocks to buy in the future. Combining it with the "export functionality feature", you can now save our displayed tables as csv files for better viewing and access, anytime, anywhere, from your laptop.
- Moving on to ***"Bonds" button***, where you can buy and sell your acquired bonds with ease, helping you achieve further profits on your little yet exciting financial journey.
- ***Premium***: In case you found your experience with us worthwhile, you can even become a premium on either monthly or yearly basis, now you can get notifications on your stocks, not to mention the detailed and clear chart which gives you a precise overview on how the stocks are going.
- Having the ***Market Performance button***, now you can see the exact changes occurring on stocks, with an exact percentage of gain or loss (the stock going up or going down), with their value displayed along with it.
- Also, there is that ***"Charting options"*** button where you can view the lifecycle of stocks. First, kindly choose the type of your chart (line chart or candlestick chart), then choose a specific period, which can start at one day up to one whole year. Don't forget to click on the *load* button and enjoy the view.
- Last but not any least, you have the ***security button***, where you can update your security however it suits you. Hope your journey as a user was fruitful and most importantly fun!

## Problems we faced:

If we're going to talk about problems, then maybe it'll take me days and days to talk about the problems faced during this tough project. It was quite tough, not many things were clear for us. We had to figure quite a lot of things out in the statement noting our too less and humble knowledge on business and finance which made it quite challenge for us. Took quite some time to understand just the specific idea in itself. Working on the project, we faced a lot of obstacles not only in coding but also in understanding the concept of the project. Also, there were some conflicted ideas in the statement in itself. One time you have to do that and the other time you have to do the opposite. We had a hard time and making classes and applying each and every one of OOP concepts on them. Too many classes actually, maybe about 40 or more, which was so tough, working and moving between these classes just to correct a parameter for example was deadly. We faced a sea of exceptions which we had to deal with seamlessly, and we did! The two parts of the project took quite a lot of time and effort. It was it was almost as if you were writing the project again from zero. It was horrible to be honest. And after so many sleepless nights, it was finally done. And that's what matters, that we made it to the end.
